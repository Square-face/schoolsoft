# Schoolsoft API wrapper

A rust api wrapper for schoolsoft's mobile app API.

Thanks to Blatzar for having made [schoolsoft-api-app](https://github.com/Blatzar/schoolsoft-api-app) which this is based on.

## INCREDIBLY UNSTABLE
Do not use this library until at has reached at least 1.0 so the api's have a chance to get a bit more stable.

## Steps until stable 1.0
- Integration into a personal project of mine to find any odd behavior and fix them
- Better and more documentation
- Optimizations
- Last minute refactoring before everything gets locked in
